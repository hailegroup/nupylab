``NUPyLab`` is a suite of tools for instrument communication and experiment
control via Python, heavily built on `PyMeasure`_.
NUPyLab was conceived primarily as a LabVIEW replacement for experiments in the
`Haile Group`_ lab, but others may find useful components as well.

Included are high-level GUIs for specific lab stations, low-level instrument
drivers, and mid-level instrument classes adapting instrument drivers to the
station GUIs. Check out `the documentation`_ for information on how to get
started with NUPyLab.
