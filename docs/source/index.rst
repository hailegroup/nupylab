Welcome to NUPyLab's documentation!
===================================

NUPyLab was conceived primarily as a LabVIEW replacement for experiments in the
`Haile Group`_ lab, but others may find useful components as well. It is
heavily built on `PyMeasure`_.

See instructions for :doc:`installation <tutorial/installation>`, then check
out how to run your own :doc:`experiment <tutorial/experiment>`.
